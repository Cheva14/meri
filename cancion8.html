    <p>
      I don't wanna smoke, I don't need a drink <br />
      Just tell me how you feel, tell me what you think <br />
      'Cause I've been on my own for a fuckin' while <br />
      And I don't need a girl, I just wanna smile <br />
      Gettin' my mind right <br />
      I wait 'til the time's right <br />
      I'm meanin' to tell you <br />
      Why it's hard to sleep at night <br />
      There's nothin' to fear now <br />
      Girl, we should be here now <br />
      So why don't you hear me out, I'm sayin' <br />
      Talk is overrated, let's just vibe <br />
      And love is overrated in my mind <br />
      Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe <br />
      Just for tonight <br />
      I'll be yours if you want me to <br />
      I'll be yours if you want me to <br />
      I've been hella stressed, I would rather chill <br />
      I know you looked at me, wonder how I deal <br />
      But look inside my soul, I don't mean to front <br />
      'Cause really I don't know what the fuck I want <br />
      I remember when we were more than friends <br />
      I would just pretend, that was cold <br />
      After all this shit, I could not let you in <br />
      Summer went, saved up all the money that I would have spent <br />
      On you, oh <br />
      Talk is overrated, let's just vibe <br />
      And love is overrated in my mind <br />
      Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe <br />
      Just for tonight <br />
      I'll be yours if you want me to <br />
      I'll be yours if you want me to <br />
      Yeah, let's talk it out <br />
      Girl, time out <br />
      I know that you only with me for the clout, sit down <br />
      You had too much to drink <br />
      Maybe it's my fault <br />
      I remember you would pull up, pour up Hennessy askin' to smoke <br />
      No, no, there you go again <br />
      Mix and blow it down <br />
      There's brand-new hoes around, yeah <br />
      And when the night is done, you be hittin' my line <br />
      Tell me your phone at one percent <br />
      3:00 a.m., you wanna vibe <br />
      Talk is overrated, let's just vibe <br />
      And love is overrated in my mind <br />
      Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe <br />
      Just for tonight <br />
      I'll be yours if you want me to <br />
      I'll be yours if you want me to <br />
