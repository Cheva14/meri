      Fuck you, and you, and you <br />
      I hate your friends and they hate me too <br />
      I'm through, I'm through, I'm through <br />
      This that hot girl bummer anthem <br />
      Turn it up and throw a tantrum <br />
      This that hot girl bummer anthem <br />
      Turn it up and throw a tantrum <br />
      This that throw up in your Birkin bag <br />
      Hook up with someone random <br />
      This that social awkward suicide <br />
      That buy your lips and buy your likes <br />
      I swear she had a man <br />
      But shit hit different when it's Thursday night <br />
      That college dropout music <br />
      Everyday leg day, she be too thick <br />
      And my friends are all annoying <br />
      But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid <br />
      This that 10K on the table <br />
      Just so we can be secluded <br />
      And the vodka came diluted <br />
      One more time, I'm superhuman <br />
      Fuck you, and you, and you <br />
      I hate your friends and they hate me too <br />
      I'm through, I'm through, I'm through <br />
      This that hot girl bummer anthem <br />
      Turn it up and throw a tantrum <br />
      Fuck you, and you, and you <br />
      I hate your friends and they hate me too <br />
      Fuck you, and you, and you <br />
      This that hot girl bummer anthem <br />
      Turn it up and throw a tantrum <br />
      This that hot girl bummer two-step <br />
      They can't box me in, I'm too left <br />
      This that drip, it's more like oceans <br />
      They can't fit me in a Trojan <br />
      Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag <br />
      Yeah, that's the slogan <br />
      This that, "Who's all there?" <br />
      I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken <br />
      This that college dropout music <br />
      Everyday leg day, she be too thick <br />
      And my friends are all annoying <br />
      But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid <br />
      This that 10K on the table <br />
      Just so we can be secluded <br />
      And the vodka came diluted <br />
      One more line, I'm superhuman <br />
      Fuck you, and you, and you <br />
      I hate your friends and they hate me too <br />
      I'm through, I'm through, I'm through <br />
      This that hot girl bummer anthem <br />

      (And you want me to change? Fuck you!) <br />
      Fuck you, and you, and you <br />
