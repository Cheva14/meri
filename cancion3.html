      Another head hangs lowly <br />
      Child is slowly taken <br />
      And the violence caused such silence <br />
      Who are we mistaken? <br />
      But you see, it's not me <br />
      It's not my family <br />
      In your head, in your head, they are fighting <br />
      With their tanks and their bombs <br />
      And their bombs, and their guns <br />
      In your head, in your head they are crying <br />
      In your head, in your head <br />
      Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie <br />
      What's in your head, in your head <br />
      Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh <br />
      Du, du, du, du <br />
      Du, du, du, du <br />
      Du, du, du, du <br />
      Du, du, du, du <br />
      Another mother's breaking heart is taking over <br />
      When the violence causes silence <br />
      We must be mistaken <br />
      It's the same old theme <br />
      Since nineteen-sixteen <br />
      In your head, in your head, they're still fighting <br />
      With their tanks and their bombs <br />
      And their bombs, and their guns <br />
      In your head, in your head, they are dying <br />
      In your head, in your head <br />
      Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie <br />
      What's in your head, in your head <br />
      Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie <br />
