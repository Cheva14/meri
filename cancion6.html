      One, two, three <br />
      Yeah, she's in love with the concept <br />
      As if we're all just how she imagined <br />
      'Cause we're in love but just don't know it yet <br />
      Well, tell me how I'm supposed to see the magic <br />
      'Cause I don't believe in it no more <br />
      But I won't tell her <br />
      'Cause I always imagined <br />
      It's easier if she thinks she won <br />
      So Imma' let her <br />
      And she said <br />
      "I don't think I love you no more." <br />
      "You never seem to call me lately" <br />
      Girl, I don't think you know me at all <br />
      'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this <br />
      No, I don't love you, and I never did <br />
      Look at us burning down in flames for kicks <br />
      But just know <br />
      I'm not singing for your XO <br />
      I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah <br />
      (Uhh) <br />
      (Yeah) <br />
      Came and went like the summertime <br />
      Is that a sunset or sunrise? <br />
      Looking back like where'd the time go <br />
      So much for trying to keep this moving slow <br />
      'Cause I don't believe in her no more <br />
      But I remember <br />
      How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted, and <br />
      I still remember what she said <br />
      "I don't think I love you no more" <br />
      "You never seem to call me lately" <br />
      But I don't think she knew me at all <br />
      'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this <br />
      But I'm no liar <br />
      And I never hid anything <br />
      You should've seen it coming to this, just know <br />
      I'm not singing for an EX though <br />
      I'm just singing 'cause it's over <br />
      Yeah, Yeah <br />
